# Historic Newspaper User Interface Review

This repository contains material related to the survey paper **"Historical Newspaper User Interfaces: A Review"** (see reference below).
23 interfaces were manually reviewed according to ca. 150 features.

### Data

The `tsv` file contains the reviews themselves, i.e. values for each surveyed features of each interface. The table has a double index (column 1 and 2) which groups features into "families".

### Charts

Various radar charts were produced from the data:

- `all-interfaces-global` : one radar charts displaying aggregated counts (as %) per feature family, across all interfaces.
- `all-interfaces-singgle` : same as abov, but with one chart per interface.
- `[feature-family]-global`: one radar charts displaying counts (as %) for each feature family, across all interfaces.

### Notebook

The notebook to produce the charts and its html version.
